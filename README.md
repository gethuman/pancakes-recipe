pancakes-common
==========

This is a temporary repo for common utilities and middleware that a pancakes
app may need. The code here will eventually be split up into a number of
smaller projects, but easier to deal with this for now.

## Installation

From the command line enter:

```
npm install pancakes-common --save
```
